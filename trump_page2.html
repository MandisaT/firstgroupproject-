		<p>Reprising a familiar battle between the two Republican presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Jeb Bush butted heads Saturday night over former president George W. Bush and U.S. involvement in the Iraq war. "Obviously the war in Iraq was a big fat mistake, alright?" Trump said at CBS News' GOP debate in Greenville, South Carolina. "George Bush made a mistake, we can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty."</p>
		<p class="opposed">"Here's what I know: Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud," Romney said. "His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's 	playing members of the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat."
    	Romney said that "dishonesty is Donald Trump's hallmark," pointing to his "bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third-grade theatrics."</p>
